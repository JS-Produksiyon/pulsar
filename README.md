# Pulsar
A Python-based GUI frontend for the [Nebula mesh network](https://github.com/slackhq/nebula) CLI client.

## Why “Pulsar”?
The Nebula mesh network tool is named after the heavenly luminous gases that contain many stars. A mesh network is rather amorphous and contains many nodes as well. 
This application makes it possible for one node to connect to the network, much like one star exists in the nebula. And because it puts out a pulse to connect,
the image of the pulsar, a magentized neutron star that pulses at a certain frequency, seemed an apt image. Thus you use Pulsar to connect to the Nebula. Enjoy!
